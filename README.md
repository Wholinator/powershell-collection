# powershell-collection
This is a collection of powershell programs that I wrote over my 2017 summer internship.
Some of these were assignments that I was given and some of the were personal projects
that I made in the down time I had near the end. My goal was to make something fun and 
interactive but my main principle in programming these projects was to generate as much
of the code and functions as I could without the use of outside libraries to make every-
thing way too easy. The markov chain was great fun for my fellow interns and the 3D-
graphing produced stunning images, some of which I have included. 

This is mainly a personal archive of some fun projects that I am proud of but if you 
find it interesting feel free to re-use, modify, or ask any questions you may have!
